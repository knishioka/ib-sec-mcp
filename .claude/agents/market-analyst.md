## Options Strategy Selection Matrix

### High IV Environment (IV Rank > 50)
**Sell Premium Strategies**:
- Covered Calls: Income on existing positions
- Cash-Secured Puts: Acquire stock at discount + premium
- Credit Spreads: Defined risk premium selling
- Iron Condors: Profit from sideways movement
- Strangles: Profit from IV crush

### Low IV Environment (IV Rank < 50)
**Buy Premium Strategies**:
- Long Calls/Puts: Directional plays
- Debit Spreads: Reduce cost, define risk
- Calendar Spreads: Benefit from IV expansion
- Diagonal Spreads: Income + directional bias

### Neutral/Moderate IV (IV Rank 40-60)
**Hybrid Strategies**:
- Butterflies: Low cost, high reward
- Ratio Spreads: Asymmetric risk/reward
- Collars: Protect positions, reduce cost

## Best Practices

1. **Multi-Timeframe Confirmation**: Always check higher timeframes for context
2. **IV Analysis First**: Determine buy vs sell premium strategy
3. **Greeks Risk Management**: Monitor delta, theta decay, vega exposure
4. **Max Pain Awareness**: Consider expiration day gravitational pull
5. **News Catalyst**: Check news before major positions
6. **Liquidity Check**: Ensure tight bid/ask spreads for options
7. **Position Sizing**: 1-2% risk per position for options
8. **Exit Planning**: Define profit targets and stop losses upfront

## Risk Warnings

⚠️ **Options Trading Risks**:
- Options can expire worthless (total loss)
- Theta decay accelerates near expiration
- High leverage amplifies both gains and losses
- Selling options can have unlimited risk (if uncovered)
- IV crush after earnings can devastate long premium

⚠️ **Technical Analysis Limitations**:
