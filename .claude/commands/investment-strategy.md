Generate comprehensive investment strategy by integrating portfolio analysis with market analysis to create unified, actionable recommendations.

**Performance Optimization**: Uses **batched sub-agent execution** with Top 5 holdings focus, achieving **7-10 minute completion** (safe for timeout).

## Task

Delegate to the **strategy-coordinator** subagent to orchestrate comprehensive investment strategy development.

### Command Usage

```bash
/investment-strategy          # Generate strategy
/investment-strategy --save   # Generate and save to file
```

### What This Command Does

The **strategy-coordinator** subagent will:

**1. Portfolio Analysis** (2 min)
- Load latest portfolio data via MCP
- Analyze CONSOLIDATED metrics across ALL accounts
- Identify top 5 holdings by value
- Assess asset allocation and concentration risks

**2. Market Analysis** (3-5 min)
- Analyze **TOP 5 HOLDINGS ONLY** for detailed technical analysis
- Launch 5 market-analyst instances in parallel
- Each provides: technical outlook, support/resistance, conviction score
- Remaining holdings: brief portfolio-based recommendations

**3. Strategy Synthesis** (2-3 min)
- Integrate portfolio metrics with market analysis
- Generate streamlined report (~4K tokens vs 15K+ old format):
  * Executive summary (key findings only)
  * Top 5 holdings with detailed recommendations
  * Remaining holdings with brief notes
  * Portfolio-level strategy (allocation, tax, risk)
  * Prioritized action plan (urgent, high, medium priority)
  * Expected outcomes

**Total Time**: 7-10 minutes (within Claude Code timeout)

   - Extract top 5 holdings by value for detailed analysis
   - Note asset allocation and concentration risks

2. Market Analysis (Batched):
   - Launch 5 market-analyst subagents in parallel (single message, multiple Task calls)
   - Analyze TOP 5 HOLDINGS ONLY
   - Request concise analysis (<500 tokens each):
     * Technical outlook (BULLISH/NEUTRAL/BEARISH)
     * Key support/resistance levels
     * Entry/exit scenarios (2-3 bullets max)
     * Options strategy (1 recommendation)
     * Conviction score (1-10)

   - Remaining holdings: 1-line summaries
   - Portfolio-level strategy: allocation, tax, risk management
   - Action plan: prioritized by urgency

4. Expected Output:

### Performance Benefits

**Old Design** (Before Optimization):
- Analyzed all 15 holdings in detail
- 15+ minutes runtime → timeout
- 15K+ token output
- ❌ Failed to complete

**New Design** (Optimized):
- Analyzes top 5 holdings in detail
- 7-10 minutes runtime ✓
- ~4K token output
- ✅ Reliable completion

### Integration

This is the **master strategy command** that:
1. Coordinates portfolio and market perspectives
2. Provides actionable, prioritized recommendations
3. Considers performance, taxes, risks, market conditions
4. Completes reliably within timeout constraints

### Related Commands

For focused analysis:
- `/analyze-stock SYMBOL` - Individual stock deep dive
- `/options-strategy SYMBOL` - Options-focused analysis
- `/optimize-portfolio` - Portfolio optimization only
- `/tax-report` - Tax-focused analysis only

### Troubleshooting

**If command times out**:
- Try individual commands instead:
  ```bash
  /optimize-portfolio           # Portfolio analysis
  /analyze-stock 9433.T         # Top holding
  /analyze-stock INDA           # Second holding
  ```

**If output is too long**:
- strategy-coordinator will automatically prioritize top 3 holdings
- Remaining holdings get 1-line summaries

**If market analysis fails**:
- strategy-coordinator falls back to portfolio data only
- Will note "[Analysis unavailable - using portfolio data]"

The **strategy-coordinator** subagent orchestrates the entire process, ensuring efficient, actionable investment strategy generation.
