Generate detailed tax analysis report including capital gains, phantom income, and optimization strategies with market timing recommendations.

## Task

Create comprehensive tax report combining tax analysis (data-analyzer) with market timing (market-analyst) for optimal tax-loss harvesting and holding period strategies.

### Report Scope

**Year Selection**:
- If $ARGUMENTS contains `--year YYYY`: Specific tax year
- If $ARGUMENTS contains `--ytd`: Year-to-date
- Otherwise: Current calendar year

**Output Options**:
- If $ARGUMENTS contains `--save`: Save to `data/processed/tax_report_YYYY.txt`
- Otherwise: Display to console only

### Orchestration Process

```
Use both data-analyzer and market-analyst subagents:

1. Tax Analysis Phase (data-analyzer):
   - Calculate capital gains/losses (short-term, long-term)
   - Identify phantom income (OID) for bonds
   - Check for wash sale violations
   - Find tax-loss harvesting candidates
   - Calculate current tax liability

2. Market Timing Analysis (market-analyst):
   - For loss harvesting candidates:
     - Analyze technical outlook
     - Recommend optimal exit timing
     - Suggest re-entry strategy after 31 days
     - Identify alternative securities (avoid wash sale)

   - For positions approaching long-term:
     - Analyze technical support levels
     - Risk of holding until long-term qualification
     - Recommend hold vs sell decision

   - For positions with gains:
     - Check technical levels for profit-taking
     - Suggest covered call strategies to defer gains
     - Identify rebalancing opportunities

3. Integrated Tax Strategy:
   - Combine tax savings with market timing
   - Prioritize by tax savings × probability of success
   - Consider technical risk of holding positions
   - Suggest options strategies for tax deferral

4. Action Plan:
   - Urgent: Execute before year-end or wash sale period
   - High Priority: Optimal tax timing with good technicals
   - Monitor: Positions to watch for tax opportunities
