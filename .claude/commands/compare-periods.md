Compare trading performance and metrics between two time periods to identify trends and changes.

## Task

Analyze and compare portfolio performance across two periods. Arguments format:

**$ARGUMENTS Format**:

- `YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD` (period1-start period1-end period2-start period2-end)
- Or: `--ytd` (compare current YTD vs previous YTD)
- Or: `--quarter` (compare current quarter vs previous quarter)
- Or: `--month` (compare current month vs previous month)

### Analysis Steps

**1. Determine Periods**

- Parse $ARGUMENTS for date ranges
- Or use preset comparisons (YTD, quarter, month)

**2. Load Data for Both Periods**

```python
# Period 1
perf1 = mcp__ib-sec-mcp__analyze_performance(
    start_date="YYYY-MM-DD",
    end_date="YYYY-MM-DD"
)

# Period 2
perf2 = mcp__ib-sec-mcp__analyze_performance(
    start_date="YYYY-MM-DD",
    end_date="YYYY-MM-DD"
)
```

**3. Calculate Deltas**
For each metric:

- Absolute change: `metric2 - metric1`
- Percentage change: `((metric2 - metric1) / metric1) * 100`
- Trend: `IMPROVING` or `DEGRADING`

**4. Attribution Analysis**
Identify what changed:

- New positions
- Closed positions
- Strategy shifts
- Cost changes

### Expected Output

```

📈 ATTRIBUTION ANALYSIS

New Positions (Period 2):
- Symbol ABC: 3 trades, +$890 P&L
- Symbol XYZ: 2 trades, +$234 P&L

Closed Positions (from Period 1):
- Symbol OLD: No longer traded
- May account for improved metrics

Strategy Changes:
💡 Increased selectivity (higher win rate, fewer trades)
💡 Better risk management (smaller losses)
⚠️ Higher commission % suggests smaller position sizes

🔍 INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

Positive Trends:
1. ✅ Trading discipline improving (win rate, profit factor up)
2. ✅ Risk management effective (reduced average loss)
3. ✅ Consistent profitability across both periods

Areas to Monitor:
1. ⚠️ Commission percentage creeping up - review trade sizing
2. 💡 Consider bulk trades to optimize fees
3. 👀 Continue current strategy - showing clear improvement

Overall Assessment: 📈 IMPROVING PERFORMANCE
- Period 2 shows meaningful improvement in key metrics
- Risk-adjusted returns are trending positively
- Minor cost efficiency concerns, but overall strong progress
